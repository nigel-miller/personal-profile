# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO | NIGEL MILLER

## Introduction
This is my first coding experience and my first website.
The object of this website is for me to practice and learn what works - whilst using only HTML5 and CSS3.
I was required to produce a Personal Portfolio as a Static front end project. The terms stated that the Portfolio be a minimum of 3 pages, or - if using a single scrolling page - then at least 3 separate page areas.
This website will be improved for readability on all screen sizes.
